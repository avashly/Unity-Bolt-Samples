# ⚡ Unity Bolt Samples

A collection of Unity packages featuring Bolt Visual Scripting samples. Each sample demonstrates how to work with Unity editor features, game logic, &amp; more without having to write a single line of code. **All samples can be found in this repo's [Releases section](https://github.com/avashly/Unity-BoltKit-Samples/releases).**

**NOTE:** 
- A Unity 2019.4 LTS or 2020.1 project with the [Universal Render Pipeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@8.2/manual/InstallingAndConfiguringURP.html) pre-installed is required to use these samples. 
- If you grab the project files directly instead of the .unitypackage, you may need to restart the editor after opening the project.

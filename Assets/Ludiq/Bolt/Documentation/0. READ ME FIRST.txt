Welcome to Bolt!

The Unity Asset Store policy requires that all 
packages provide basic local documentation, 
which is what you will find in the PDF files 
in this directory.

However, we strongly suggest using the online
manual, which is more complete and always up-to-date.
The PDF documentation is rarely updated.
Also, the online documentation has animated gifs,
which are converted to static images in PDFs.

If you have questions, bug reports, or feature requests,
you can submit them in the online Bolt community forum.

Now go create something awesome.

Thanks for your purchase!
